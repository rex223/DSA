// What is pivot? ---- a reference element
// chose any element as pivot and after first pass all the elements on the left hand side of the pivot
// will be smaller than the pivot and all the larger elements will be on the right hand side of the pivot
// In quick sort the pivot is put at the correct position after every pass
// It is not stable and in place sorting
// A non-stable sorting algorithm does not preserve the relative order of equal elements in the sorted output. This means that if two elements have the same key (value), their original order in the input may change in the final sorted sequence.
